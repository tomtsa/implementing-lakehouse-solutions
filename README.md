# Implementing lakehouse solutions

A public repository for the Fabric Demo presented in the Hovi course: **Designing and Implementing Data Lakehouse Solutions**. This repository is used in the latter part of the demo: **Implementing Medallion Architecture**.

You can use this repository to see the codes and objects presented in the demo and return to them later if you are interested.

If you have access to Microsoft Fabric, you can also fork this repository to your personal repository and connect that to your Fabric Workspace and test how they work in action. Here is a detailed instructions on how to do that: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/cicd/git-integration/git-get-started?tabs=github%2CGitHub%2Ccommit-to-git

Note that your Fabric Admin has to allow the GitHub integration for you to connect to GitHub. If this is not an option, you can migrate this repository to Azure DevOps instead and use that.
